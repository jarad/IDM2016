We consider a measles outbreak in Harare, Zimbabwe from 2009-2010 where a total of 156 individual cases were confirmed in the weekly recorded surveillance system over the course of a year. We model the data with a Poisson-binomial discrete-time state-space model where the states are epidemiological compartments, e.g. susceptible, infectious, recovered, etc. The state transitions are assumed to have a Poisson distribution while observations on these transitions have a binomial distribution and generally only occur when an individual transitions to infectious, i.e. shows symptoms and is contagious. A Bayesian approach is utilized to incorporate prior information on the initial states of the system, i.e. the transition rates parameters and the binomial probabilities. We present methodology called particle learning for sequentially estimating both the state of the system, i.e. current number of infectious individuals, and the static parameters, i.e. the transition rates and binomial probabilites. This particle learning methodology utilizes the sufficient statistic structure contained in the model to combat particle degeneracy. We conclude with an application of this methodology to the measles outbreak in Harare.
